# OSINTer & Hacking Tools

A program created specifically for hackers and OSINT researchers based on Python. It was originally supposed to be called "Instagram Phone Number Extractor", but thanks to the addition of new tools, we renamed it "OSINTer & Hacking Tools".

## ATTENTION ⚠
All actions that you perform using this program are carried out at your own risk. With the exception of OSINT functionality, we are not responsible for your careless actions.

## BETA 3 version
BETA 3 is currently available, but we plan to release it before BETA 20.

## Plans for BETA 4
In the next update, BETA 4, we plan to add the following hacking and OSINT features:

1. **Apple iOS Device Tracking**: This feature will allow you to track mobile devices running the Apple iOS operating system. You will be able to receive information about the location, activity and other device parameters, which can be useful for research and analysis.

2. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Adds the ability to scan and analyze vulnerabilities in network devices and web applications. This will help you identify weaknesses and security issues that can be exploited by attackers.

3. **Social Engineering**: Extending functionality for social engineering. This includes collecting information about targets, creating phishing attacks, and analyzing user behavior.

4. **Integration with Leak Databases**: Connect to leak databases so that you can check if your credentials have been compromised.

5. **Collecting data from social networks**: Adding the ability to collect information from various social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and others. This will help you create goal profiles and analyze their activity.

If you have any questions or would like to cooperate with us in the development of the program, do not hesitate to contact us by e-mail: ulevaskevic@gmail.com .
